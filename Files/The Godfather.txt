I believe in America.
America has made my fortune.
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.
I gave her freedom, but I taught
her never to dishonor her family.
She found a boyfriend,
not an Italian.
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.
Two months ago he took her for a
drive with another boyfriend.
They made her drink whiskey
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.
She resisted, she
kept her honor.
So they beat her like an animal.
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.
But I wept. Why did I weep?
She was the light of my life.
Beautiful girl.
Now she will never
be beautiful again.
Sorry.
I went to the police,
like a good American.
These two boys were
brought to trial.
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,
but suspended the sentence.
Suspended the sentence! They
went free that very day!
I stood in the
courtroom like a fool.
Those two bastards,
they smiled at me.
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."
Why did you go to the police? Why
didn't you come to me first?
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.
What is that?
I want them dead.
That I cannot do.
I'll give you anything you ask.
I've known you many years, but this is
the first time you've asked for help.
I can't remember the last time you
invited me for a cup of coffee.
Even though my wife is
godmother to your only child.
But let's be Frank here. You
never wanted my friendship.
And you were afraid
to be in my debt.
I didn't want to
get into trouble.
I understand.
You found Paradise in America.
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.
You didn't need a
friend like me.
But now you come to me and say,
"Don Corleone, give me justice."
But you don't ask with respect.
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.
I ask you for justice.
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.
Let them suffer, then,
as she suffers.
How much shall I pay you?
Bonasera, Bonasera.
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?
If you'd come in friendship,
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.
And then they would fear you.
Be my friend?
Godfather?
Good.
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.
But until that day
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.
- GrÃ zie, Godfather.
- Prego.
Give this to Clemenza.
I want people that aren't
going to get carried away.
We're not murderers, in spite
of what this undertaker says.
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.
We're not taking the
picture without Michael.
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.
Don Barzini.
Hey, Paulie! Let
me have some wine.
Paulie! More wine.
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?
Take a walk and do your job.
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.
You watch yourself, all right?
20, 30 grand. In
small bills, cash.
In that little silk purse.
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!
Hey, Paulie!
I got two gabagool,
capocol, and a prosciut.
Stupid jerk!
What's the matter?
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.
Get out of here! It's a
private party. Go on!
What is it? It's my
sister's wedding.
Goddamn FBI don't
respect nothing!
Come here, come here, come here!
But towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,
so for six months he's
worked in my pastry shop.
Nazorine, what can I do for you?
Now that the war is over,
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.
You understand everything.
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
Wait till you see the wedding
cake I made for your daughter!
The bride, the groom
and the angel...
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.
Give it to a Jew Congressman
in another district.
Who else is on the list?
Hey, Michael!
He's not on the list, but
Luca Brasi wants to see you.
Is this necessary?
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me
on the wedding day
of your daughter.
May their first child
be a masculine child.
Michael...
That man over there is
talking to himself.
See that scary guy over there?
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?
His name is Luca Brasi. He
helps my father out sometimes.
Michael, he's coming over here!
You look terrific!
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.
Your father's been
asking for you.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Why does your brother
have a different name?
My brother Sonny found
Tom Hagen in the street.
He had no home, so my
father took him in.
He's been with us ever since.
He's a good lawyer.
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.
- What's that?
- That's a,
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.
You like your lasagna?
Don Corleone.
I'm honored and grateful
that you have invited me to
your daughter's wedding.
On the day of your
daughter's wedding.
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.
Thank you.
Signora Corleone!
No!
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.
What is that outside?
Johnny! Johnny!
I love you!
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!
You never said you
knew Johnny Fontane!
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?
How?
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...
Please, Michael. Tell me.
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract
with a big bandleader.
And as his career got better and
better, he wanted to get out of it.
Johnny is my father's godson.
My father went to see
this bandleader.
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,
but the bandleader said no.
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.
Within an hour,
he signed a release for a
certified check of $ 1,000.
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.
That's a true story.
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.
Beautiful!
I'll take care of it.
Tom...
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.
How are you, Fredo?
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.
- Hi.
- How are you doing?
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?
Yeah. This is your friend?
I don't know what to do. My
voice is weak. It's weak.
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.
But this... man won't give it
to me, the head of the studio.
- What's his name?
- Woltz.
He won't give it to me, and
he says there's no chance.
Sonny?
Sonny?
Sonny?
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?
The old man wants you.
One minute.
A month ago he bought the movie
rights to this book, a best-seller.
The main character is
a guy just like me.
I wouldn't even have to act.
Godfather, I don't
know what to do.
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?
"What can I do? What can I
do?" What is that nonsense?
Ridiculous.
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.
Good.
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.
It's too late, they start
shooting in a week.
I'm going to make him an
offer he can't refuse.
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.
Carlo, we're going
to take the picture.
Wait a minute.
No, Michael. Not me.
Okay, that's it. Just like that.
Hold it!
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.
This friend would give his
friendship to Mr. Woltz,
if Mr. Woltz would
grant us a favor.
Woltz is listening.
Give Johnny the part in that war
film you're starting next week.
And what favor would your
friend grant Mr. Woltz?
He could make your future
union problems disappear.
And one of your stars has just
moved from marijuana to heroin.
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!
Let me lay it on the line.
Johnny Fontane will
never get that movie!
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.
I'll wait for your call.
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.
Check him out.
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.
- It used to decorate a King's palace.
- Very nice.
Why didn't you say you
work for Corleone?
I thought you were some cheap
hustler Johnny was running in.
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.
You do appreciate
beauty, don't you?
There you are. $600,000
on four hoofs.
I bet Russian czars never
paid that for a single horse.
Khartoum.
Khartoum.
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.
Thanks, Tony.
Let's get something to eat.
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
To the Italian people that's a
very sacred, close relationship.
I respect it. Tell him
to ask me anything else.
This favor I can't give him.
He never asks a second favor when
he's been refused the first.
You don't understand. Johnny
Fontane never gets that movie.
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.
I'm going to run him out of the
business, and let me tell you why.
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protÃ©gÃ©s.
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.
Let me be even more Frank.
To show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man.
That it's not all
dollars and cents.
She was beautiful. She
was young and innocent!
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
And she runs off.
She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!
You get the hell out of here!
If that goombah tries any rough
stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader.
Yeah, I heard that story.
Thank you for dinner and
a very pleasant evening.
Maybe your car can take
me to the airport.
Mr. Corleone insists on
hearing bad news immediately.
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.
I have the Sollozzo notes here.
Now...
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife,
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.
His business is narcotics.
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.
In Sicily he has plants to
process them into heroin.
He needs cash, he needs
protection from the police.
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.
He's known as a top
narcotics man.
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.
Tom?
Yes. There's more money in
narcotics than anything else.
If we don't get into it, somebody
else will, maybe the five families.
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.
Then they come after us.
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?
Don Corleone.
I need a man who has
powerful friends.
I need a million
dollars in cash.
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.
In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.
And then it would go up.
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?
My compliments.
I'll take care of them,
out of my share.
So I receive 30% for finance,
political influence
and legal protection?
That's right.
Why do you come to me? Why do
I deserve this generosity?
If you consider a million
dollars in cash just finance,
te salud Don Corleone.
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,
to be treated with respect.
But, I must say no to you.
And I'll give you my reason.
It's true, I have a lot
of friends in politics.
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.
It doesn't make any difference to
me what a man does for a living.
But your business is...
a little dangerous.
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.
I have a sentimental weakness for
my children, and I spoil them.
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish
to congratulate you on your new business.
I know you'll do
well, and good luck.
Especially since your interests don't
conflict with mine. Thank you.
Santino.
Come here.
What's the matter with you?
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.
Go on.
Tom, what's this nonsense?
It's from Johnny. He's
starring in that new film.
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.
And
tell Luca Brasi to come in.
I'm a little worried about
this Sollozzo fellow.
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.
Go to the Tattaglias.
Make them think that you're
not too happy with our family
and find out what you can.
I got something for your
mother and for Sonny
and a tie for Freddy, and Tom
Hagen got the Reynolds pen.
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.
Andiamo, Fredo.
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.
I'll have to get it myself. Paulie
called in sick this morning.
Paulie's a good kid. I don't
mind getting the car.
Buon natale, Caro. GrÃ zie.
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.
You know who I am?
I know you.
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?
I think you and I
can do business.
I need someone strong like you.
I heard you are not happy...
with the Corleone family.
Want to join me?
What's in it for me?
$50,000 to start with.
Not bad!
Agreed?
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.
Make time, Consigliere.
Get in the car.
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.
Get in.
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.
Merry Christmas. I
want some fruit.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Like in the story.
No.
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.
Michael.
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.
What's the matter?
They don't say if
he's dead or alive.
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?
No. Look, come home, kid. You
should be with Mama, you hear?
Oh, my God.
Sonny!
Stay back there.
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.
There's more news
about your old man.
Word is out that
he's already dead.
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.
- How often?
- Only three, four times.
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.
I don't care how sick he is. Bring
him to my father's house right now.
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.
I'm going to have a couple of our
people come over to the house.
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.
In three hours he'll be
released with our proposition.
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.
What's done is done. Don't lose
that famous temper of yours, Sonny.
I'll wait.
Your boss is dead.
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.
I want you to help the
Corleones and me.
We got him outside his office about
an hour after we picked you up.
Drink it.
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.
Sonny was hot for
my deal, wasn't he?
And you knew it was the
right thing to do.
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don rest in peace was slipping.
Ten years ago, could I
have gotten to him?
Well, now he's dead, Tom, and
nothing can bring him back.
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.
It's good business, Tom.
I'll try. But even Sonny won't
be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Yeah, well...
Let me worry about Luca.
You just talk to Sonny.
And the other two kids.
- I'll do my best.
- Good.
Now you can go.
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.
Blood is a big expense.
He's still alive.
They hit him with five
shots, and he's still alive!
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.
Your mother is at the
hospital with your father.
Looks like he'll pull through.
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.
What about Luca? Sollozzo
thinks he can control him.
If Luca sold out, we're
in a lot of trouble.
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
This is almost 1946. Nobody
wants bloodshed anymore.
If your father dies
you make the deal.
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.
What is it?
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.
Tessio, go see what it is.
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.
Hanging around the house on the
phone would be a big help.
Try Luca again.
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?
Probably late.
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.
We have to find a spot on the West Side.
Try 309 West 43rd Street.
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.
Think while you're driving. I
want to hit New York this month.
Watch the kids.
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.
Yeah, all right.
Make sure they're clean, because the
guys will be there a long time.
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.
Exterminate! Watch out, so
we don't exterminate you!
Pull over. I've got
to take a leak.
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!
- Yeah.
- Phone call!
- Who is it?
- Some girl.
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?
He's going to make it.
I love you.
I love you!
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.
Can't you say it?
I'll see you tonight.
Why don't you tell that
nice girl you love her?
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.
You start with a little
oil, then fry some garlic.
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.
Add a little bit of wine.
And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?
You won't see him no more.
- Where are you going?
- To the city.
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...
He'll be all right. Sollozzo
knows he's a civilian.
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.
Send somebody with him anyway.
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?
No, Kay. There will be detectives
there, people from the press.
I'll wait in the cab.
I don't want you
to get involved.
When will I see you again?
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.
What are you doing here? You're
not supposed to be here.
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.
What happened to the guards?
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got
here late, there's nobody here.
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.
Papa's all alone.
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.
I'm sorry, but you
will have to leave.
We're going to move
him to another room.
Can you disconnect the tubes?
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?
Help me, please.
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the Baker.
- Remember me?
- Enzo.
You'd better go, there's
going to be trouble.
If there is trouble, I'll stay
here to help you. For your father.
Listen. Wait for me outside, in
front of the hospital, all right?
I'll be out in a minute.
Just lie here, Pop. I'll
take care of you now.
I'm with you now.
I'm with you.
Get rid of these. Come here.
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun.
You'll be all right.
You did good.
I thought all you Guinea
hoods were locked up!
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.
Stand him up straight.
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.
They're licensed
to carry firearms.
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show 'cause.
Let him go.
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.
After the hospital
thing, Sonny got mad.
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
this morning.
Jesus Christ.
Looks like a fortress
around here.
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead.
Mike, let me look at you.
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?
What did he say... He wants us to
send Michael to hear the proposition.
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.
No more! Not this
time, Consigliere.
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.
I want Sollozzo,
or we go to war...
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!
This is business, not personal!
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.
No more advice on how to patch things up.
Just help me win.
I found out about Captain
McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.
McCluskey has agreed to
be The Turk's bodyguard.
So when Sollozzo is being
guarded, he's invulnerable.
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.
Do me a favor. Take this
into consideration.
All right, we'll wait.
We can't wait. We can't wait.
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?
They want to have a
meeting with me, right?
It will be me, McCluskey
and Sollozzo.
Let's set the meeting.
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.
Some place where there are
people, so I feel safe.
They'll search me when
I meet them, right?
So I can't have a weapon on me.
But if Clemenza can figure out a way
to have a weapon planted there for me
then I'll kill them both.
Nice college boy. Didn't want to get
mixed up in the family business.
Now you want to shoot a police
captain because he slapped you?
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.
You're taking this
very personal.
Tom, this is business and
he's taking it personal.
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed
up in drugs, a dishonest cop.
A cop who got mixed up in the
rackets and got what was coming.
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.
It's as cold as they come.
Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints.
I put a special tape on the
trigger and the butt. Try it.
Is the trigger too tight?
My ears!
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.
Let your hand drop to your
side and let the gun slip out.
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,
so walk out fast, but don't run.
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.
They'll be scared stiff, so
don't worry about nothing.
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,
and we'll catch the hell.
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.
All the other families will
probably line up against us.
These things have to happen
every five, 10 years.
Gets rid of the bad blood.
Been 10 years since the last one. You
have to stop them at the beginning.
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you.
Being a hero and all.
Your father too.
Nothing. Not a hint.
Absolutely nothing.
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.
How much time do we have?
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.
Sollozzo might not even
be in the car, Sonny!
I'll get it.
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.
He'll be there between 8 and 10.
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.
All right. Mike, you
go to the restaurant,
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.
I want somebody very
good to plant that gun.
I don't want him coming
out with just his dick.
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.
Let's move.
Did he tell you to drop
the gun right away?
Yeah, a million times.
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.
How long do you think it will
be before I can come back?
At least a year.
I'll square it with Mom, that you're
not seeing her before you leave and...
I'll get a message to that
girlfriend when the time is right.
Take care.
Take care, Mike.
I'm glad you came. I hope we
can straighten everything out.
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.
I want to straighten everything out. I
don't want my father bothered again.
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.
But you have to keep an
open mind when we talk.
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.
He's a good kid.
I'm sorry about the
other night, Mike.
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.
He's clean.
Going to Jersey?
Maybe.
Nice work, Lou.
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.
I'll have it.
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.
What I want...
What's most important to me
is that I have a guarantee. No
more attempts on my father's life.
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!
I missed my chance. You
think too much of me, kid.
I'm not that clever.
All I want is a truce.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?
When you got to go,
you got to go.
He's clean.
Don't take too long.
I've frisked a thousand punks.
Okay, you take over.
I love you, Grandpa.
I'm sorry, Pa. He
doesn't know you yet.
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.
" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."
Go with your mother.
Take them downstairs.
Go on, Carlo, you too.
Go on.
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.
They hit us, so
we hit them back.
Through our newspaper contacts we've
been able to put out material
about McCluskey's link with
Sollozzo in the drug rackets.
So things are loosening up.
And I'm sending
Fredo to Las Vegas,
under the protection of
Don Francesco of L.A.
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.
Where's Michael?
It was Michael who
killed Sollozzo.
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back.
I want you to find out where that
old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
I want him now.
Sonny, things are
starting to loosen up.
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
Ma made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.
That's because they've
started making big money.
Papa never talked
business at the table.
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.
Don't interfere.
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...
We don't discuss
business at the table.
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.
Why are you so far
from the house?
You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.
The bodyguards are here.
It's still dangerous...
We've heard from
Santino in New York...
Your enemies know you're here.
Did Santino say
when I can go back?
Not yet.
It's out of the question.
Where are you going now?
To Corleone.
Take my car.
I want to walk.
Be careful.
Where have all the men gone?
They're all dead from vendettas.
There are the names of the dead.
Hey, hey, take me to
the America, G.I.!
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable!
America! Take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!
Mamma Mia what a beauty.
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.
Did you have a good hunt?
You know all the
girls around here?
We saw some real beauties.
One of them struck our
friend like a thunderbolt.
She would tempt the
devil himself.
Really put together.
Right, Calo?
Such hair, such mouth!
The girls around here are beautiful...
but virtuous.
This one had a purple dress...
And a purple ribbon in her hair.
A type more Greek than Italian.
Do you know her?
There's no girl like
that in this town.
My God, I understand!
What's wrong?
Let's go.
It's his daughter.
Tell him to come here.
Call him.
Fabrizio, you translate.
I apologize if I offended you.
I'm a stranger in this country.
I meant no disrespect to
you or your daughter.
I'm an American,
hiding in Sicily.
My name is Michael Corleone.
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.
But then your daughter
would lose a father
instead of gaining a husband.
I want to meet your daughter.
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.
With all respect.
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.
What's her name?
I'll knock you dizzy.
Save it for the library.
We've got to pick up my sister.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?
It was my fault. I hit him.
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...
I'm just going to get a
doctor to take a look at you.
Sonny, please don't do anything.
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?
You spic slobs still
betting Yankees?
Tell them to stop
taking in action.
We lost enough money last week.
Come here, come here!
If you touch my sister
again, I'll kill you.
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.
Yes, I have. I've tried
writing and calling.
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.
All we know is that
he's all right.
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.
Tom, will you give this
letter to Michael. Please?
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.
He'll get in touch with you.
I let my cab go, so can I
call another one, please?
Come on. Sorry.
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.
Tell him that I can't make
it tonight until later.
Bitch!
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!
I'll vafangool you!
She has a filthy mouth,
this Guinea brat.
That's it, break it all, you
spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!
Why don't you bring your
whore home for dinner?
Maybe I will.
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!
You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up!
Clean it up!
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!
Clean it up. Clean
that up, you...
Clean it!
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be
a murderer, like your father!
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!
Come on, kill me!
Get out of here!
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.
You Guinea brat.
Get out of here!
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.
Connie, talk louder.
The baby's crying.
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.
Yeah, Connie.
You wait there.
No, you just wait there.
Son-of-a-bitch.
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.
Sonny!
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!
Go after him, go on!
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!
Give me a drop.
My wife is crying upstairs.
I hear cars coming to the house.
Consigliere of mine,
tell your Don what
everyone seems to know.
I didn't tell Mama anything.
I was about to come up and
wake you and tell you.
But you needed a drink first.
Yeah.
Well, now you've had your drink.
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.
I want no inquiries made.
I want no acts of vengeance.
I want you to arrange a meeting
with the heads of
the five families.
This war stops now.
Call Bonasera.
I need him now.
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.
You owe your Don a service.
He has no doubt that
you will repay it.
He will be at your funeral
parlor in one hour.
Be there to greet him.
Well, my friend, are you
ready to do me this service?
Yes. What do you want me to do?
I want you to use all your
powers and all your skills.
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.
Look how they massacred my boy.
It's safer to teach you English!
I know English...
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.
Greetings, Don Tommasino.
How are things in Palermo?
Michael is teaching me to drive...
watch, I'll show you.
How are things in Palermo?
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...
times are changing
for the worse.
This place has become
too dangerous for you.
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.
What's wrong?
Bad news from America.
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.
Let's go... you promised.
Fabrizio!
Get the car.
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?
No, take her to her father's
house until things are safe.
Okay, anything you say.
Calo, where is Apollonia?
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.
She'll make a good
American wife.
Wait, I'll get the baggage.
Fabrizio!
Where are you going?
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
No, Apollonia!
Don Barzini, I want to thank you for
helping me organize this meeting,
and the other heads of the five
families from New York and New Jersey.
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,
and from Brooklyn
Philip Tattaglia.
And from Staten Island
we have with us Victor Strachi.
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.
How did things ever get so far?
I don't know.
It was so unfortunate,
so unnecessary.
Tattaglia lost a son,
and I lost a son.
We're quits. And if
Tattaglia agrees,
then I'm willing to let
things go on as before.
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.
Yes, Don Barzini.
He's too modest.
He had all the judges and
politicians in his pocket.
He refused to share them.
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?
All of you know me.
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.
It's not like gambling
or liquor or even women,
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.
I believed that then and
I believe that now.
Times have changed.
It's not like the old days, when
we could do anything we wanted.
A refusal is not the
act of a friend.
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them
or let others use them. He must let
us draw the water from the well.
Certainly he can present a
bill for such services.
After all, we're not communists.
I also don't believe in drugs.
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.
Somebody says to them
" I have powders."
" If you put up 3-4,000
dollar investment,
we can make 50,000
distributing."
They can't resist. I want to control
it as a business, keep it respectable.
I don't want it near schools, I
don't want it sold to children.
Thats an infÃ mia.
In my city we would keep the
traffic to the colored.
They're animals, so let
them lose their souls.
I hoped that we could come
here and reason together.
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.
I must have strict
assurance from Corleone.
As time goes by and his
position becomes stronger,
will he attempt any
individual vendetta?
We are all reasonable men. We
don't have to give assurances.
You talk about vengeance.
Will vengeance bring
your son back to you?
Or my boy to me?
I forgo the vengeance of my son.
But I have selfish reasons.
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country
because of this
Sollozzo business.
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.
Cleared of all these
false charges.
But I'm a superstitious man.
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,
or if he should hang
himself in his jail cell,
or if he's struck by
a bolt of lightning,
then I'm going to blame some
of the people in this room.
And that I do not forgive.
But, that aside
let me say that I swear
on the souls of
my grandchildren,
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?
Mention it. Don't insist.
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.
Tattaglia's a pimp.
He could never have
outfought Santino.
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.
Come on, Nancy.
Keep together, everyone. Brian.
Okay, all right.
How long have you been back?
I've been back a year.
Longer than that, I think.
It's good to see you, Kay.
I'm working for my
father now, Kay.
He's been sick. Very sick.
But you're not like him.
You told me you weren't going
to become like your father.
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.
Any man who's responsible
for other people.
Like a senator or president.
- How naive you sound.
- Why?
They don't have men killed.
Who's being naive, Kay?
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.
In five years the Corleone family is
going to be completely legitimate.
Trust me. That's all I can tell
you about my business. Kay...
Michael, why did you come here?
Why?
What do you want with
me after all this time?
I've been calling and writing.
I came because I need you.
I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...
I'll do anything you ask to make
up for what's happened to us.
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that
we have each other. That
we have a life together.
That we have children.
Our children.
Kay, I need you.
And I love you.
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.
Don Corleone...
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.
Michael is now head
of the family.
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.
After we make the move to Nevada
you can leave the Corleone
family and go on your own.
- How long will that be?
- Six months.
Forgive me, but with you gone,
me and Pete will come
under Barzini's thumb.
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.
That's all I can tell you now.
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
That's no reflection on
Tom, just how I want it.
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.
Mike... Why am I out?
You're not a wartime
consigliere, Tom.
Things may get rough
with the move.
Tom.
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.
I thought Santino was a
bad Don, rest in peace.
Michael has all my
confidence, just as you do.
But there are reasons why you must have
no part in what is going to happen.
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.
I can't get over the way
your face looks. So good!
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!
Leave them out here. He's
tired and wants to clean up.
Let me open the door, all right?
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?
I'll be right back.
Keep them occupied.
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.
I'm tired. Get rid
of the band too.
Hey, take off. Take off.
Let's go.
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.
Hey, come on! Scram!
Come on, honey. I don't know what's
the matter with him, Johnny.
Sorry.
I don't know. He's tired.
What happened to Moe Greene?
He had some business. He said to give
him a call when the party started.
Well, give him a call.
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.
Well, I owe it all to him.
He knows how grateful you are.
That's why he'd like
to ask a favor of you.
Mike, what can I do?
We're thinking of
giving up our interests
in the olive oil business
and settling here.
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.
- Tom!
- Are you sure?
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothing about selling.
I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.
See, Johnny...
We figure that entertainment would
draw gamblers to the casino.
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.
We're counting on you.
Sure, Mike. I'll do
anything for my godfather.
Good.
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?
Have everything? Specially prepared food,
the best dancers, and good credit.
Draw chips for everybody, so
they can play on the house.
Is my credit good
enough to buy you out?
Buy me out?
The casino, the hotel.
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?
No, I buy you out.
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.
You Guineas make me laugh.
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!
You did that because we
bankrolled your casino
and the Molinari family
guaranteed his safety.
Let's talk business.
Yes. First of all,
you're all done.
You don't have that
kind of muscle anymore.
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.
Do you think you can come
to my hotel and take over?
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!
Is that why you slapped my
brother around in public?
That was nothing, Mike. Moe
didn't mean nothing by that.
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.
I have a business to run. I've
got to kick asses sometimes.
We had an argument, so I
had to straighten him out.
You straightened my brother out?
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.
What's wrong with you?
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.
Son-of-a-bitch!
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when
you were out with cheerleaders.
Wait a minute, Moe.
I have an idea.
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.
If you have anything to
say, say it to Michael.
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!
Fredo...
You're my older brother,
and I love you.
But don't ever take sides with
anyone against the family again.
Ever.
I have to see my father and his
people, so have dinner without me.
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.
Your sister wants to
ask you something.
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.
They want you to be
godfather to their boy.
- We'll see.
- Will you?
Let me think about it. Come on.
Barzini will move
against you first.
He'll set up a meeting with
someone you absolutely trust.
Guaranteeing your safety.
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.
I don't know.
Are you happy with your
wife and children?
- Very happy.
- That's good.
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.
I spend my life trying
not to be careless.
Women and children can be
careless, but not men.
- How's your boy?
- He's good.
He looks more like
you every day.
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.
Read the funny papers.
I want you to arrange for a telephone man
to check all in-and out-going calls.
I did it already. I
took care of that, Pop.
That's right. I forgot.
What's the matter?
What's bothering you?
I'll handle it. I told you I can
handle it, so I'll handle it.
I knew that Santino would
have to go through all this.
And Fredo...
Fredo was, well...
But I never wanted this for you.
I worked my whole life. I don't
apologize for taking care of my family.
And I refused to be a fool,
dancing on a string held
by all those big shots.
I don't apologize. That's my
life, but I thought that,
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.
Another pezzonovante.
Well...
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.
We'll get there, Pop.
We'll get there.
Now listen, whoever comes to
you with this Barzini meeting,
he's the traitor.
Don't forget that.
Can I hold it, please?
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.
Over here, over here.
Be careful. You're spilling it.
Anthony!
Come here, come here.
That's it. We'll put
it right there.
I'll show you something.
Come here.
Stand there.
Give me an orange!
That's a new trick.
You run in there. Run in there.
Where are you?
Mike, can I have a minute?
Barzini wants to
arrange a meeting.
He says we can straighten
out any of our problems.
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.
I can arrange security.
On my territory.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you know how they're
going to come at you?
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground.
Where I'll be safe.
I always thought it would
be Clemenza, not Tessio.
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.
But I'm going to wait.
After the baptism.
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.
And then I'll meet with Don
Barzini and Tattaglia.
All the heads of
the five families.
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?
I do.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?
I do.
Do you believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?
I do.
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
Oh, God!
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.
Michael Rizzi, will
you be baptized?
I will.
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and
may the Lord be with you. Amen.
Kay!
Kiss your godfather.
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.
Everybody has to
leave without us.
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.
I'll only be a couple of days.
We're on our way to Brooklyn.
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.
I can't go either, Sal.
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.
Tom, can you get
me off the hook?
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.
That little farce you
played with my sister.
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.
Don't do this to me, please.
Barzini is dead.
So is Philip Tattaglia.
Moe Greene.
Strachi. Cuneo.
Today I settle all family business, so
don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.
Admit what you did.
Get him a drink.
Come on.
Don't be afraid, Carlo.
Do you think I'd make
my sister a widow?
I'm godfather to
your son, Carlo.
Go ahead, drink, drink.
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.
You're finished. I'm putting
you on a plane to Vegas.
Tom.
I want you to stay there.
Understand?
Only don't tell me
you're innocent.
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.
Who approached you?
Tattaglia or Barzini?
It was Barzini.
Good.
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.
I'll call your wife and tell
her what flight you're on.
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.
Hello, Carlo.
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!
Michael!
- What is it?
- Where is he?
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?
Connie.
Why do you think he
kept Carlo at the Mall?
He knew he was
going to kill him.
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!
That's your husband,
that's your husband!
No! No, no...
Take her upstairs.
Get her a doctor.
She's hysterical.
Hysterical.
Michael, is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!
All right.
This one time.
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.
Is it true?
Is it?
No.
I guess we both need a drink.
Come on.
Don Corleone.
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!
They've killed your son Paolo!
Murderers! Murderers!
My son...
All my respect, Don Ciccio.
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo...
...because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.
He's all I have left.
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!
Vito, run!
Move and I'll kill him!
Run, Vito!
Kill him!
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!
You understand?
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!
Vito, we're praying for you!
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...
...turn him over to us.
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!
Nurse.
Money?
Interpreter!
Where are you from?
-What is your name?
-Maria.
What is your name?
Come on, son. What is your name?
Vito Andolini from Corleone.
Corleone. Vito Corleone.
Okay, over there.
Next.
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.
Vito Corleone!
Vito Corleone!
Here he is. This is him.
Did you bring the car keys?
Laurie! Laurie!
Mama!
Mama!
-Look who's here.
-Father Carmelo.
-This is Father Carmelo.
-I'm Merle Johnson.
Mama!
-Here I am.
-Constanzia, after one week?
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!
-What is this?
-You remember Merle?
Hello. How are you? Thank you.
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.
You go see your children first.
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
<i>A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.</i>
<i>Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.</i>
<i>And there is Mrs. Geary.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs. Geary.</i>
<i>We see Nevada far too seldom.</i>
<i>But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends</i>
<i>and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.</i>
<i>And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.</i>
<i>I have here in my hand a check
made out to the university</i>
<i>and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of</i>
<i>Anthony Vito Corleone.</i>
<i>The check is signed by
that young man's parents</i>
<i>whom I think we should recognize.</i>
<i>Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!</i>
<i>Folks, I want you to join me</i>
<i>in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!</i>
<i>We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir</i>
<i>who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement</i>
<i>to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.</i>
<i>Boys.</i>
The plaque.
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?
Okay, that's good.
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs. Corleone.
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.
-Yes, yes.
-Sit down.
I thought that you and
I would talk alone.
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.
Well, it's perfectly all right with me
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.
Maybe more frankly
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas
and one in Reno.
The licenses were grandfathered in
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.
Now my sources tell me
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.
-Turnbull is a good man.
-Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.
You can have the license.
The price is 250,000 dollars.
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly
of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.
The price for the license
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?
That's right.
-Why would I pay more than that?
-Because I intend to squeeze you.
I don't like your kind of people.
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair
dressed up in those silk suits
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.
Senator,
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.
But never think it applies to my family.
All right, all right.
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.
Don't you contact me again, ever.
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.
My offer is this...
Nothing.
Not even the fee for the gaming license,
which I would like you to put up.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.
-Honey, we have to go.
-Really? I'm sorry.
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!
Frank Pentangeli!
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!
I've got to check on my boys.
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says, "canapÃ©s".
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"
Bring out the peppers and sardines!
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?
No, that was no heart attack.
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.
Rocco.
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.
Johnny?
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.
Sure, Mike.
-What are you drinking, Johnny?
-Anisette.
-If you need anything, I'll be outside.
-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?
It's not good.
Can I do anything or send anything?
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.
That casino...
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group
and our friend in Miami.
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.
One by one, our old friends are gone.
Death, natural or not,
prison, deported...
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!
Let's have a tarantella!
You! Up, up, up!
<i>Questa mano!</i>
<i>Questa mano!</i>
What the hell have we here?
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too. May I stay?
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?
Al, please get him a drink!
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on The Queen.
Why don't you go to a travel agent?
We're getting married first.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?
You see your children on weekends.
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.
You fly around the world
with men who use you!
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?
I need money.
Connie, Connie, Connie...
I want to be reasonable with you.
Why don't you stay with the family?
You can live on the estate
with your kids.
You won't be deprived of anything.
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.
He'll understand, believe me.
Connie.
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,
you'll disappoint me.
<i>-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!</i>
What's "Chen dannay"?
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!
I know, I know.
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.
You're justjealous
because he's a real man!
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!
Fredo!
-I can't control her, Mikey.
-You're my brother, don't apologize.
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.
You took over and didn't give it to them.
I welched.
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.
-He hated them more than I do.
-Frankie, they feel cheated.
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgment on how I run my family.
Your family's still called Corleone.
And you'll run it like a Corleone.
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...
...and doesn't eat in Miami...
...with Hyman Roth!
You're a good old man and I like you.
You were loyal to my father for years.
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.
-Not touched?
-No, I want you to be fair with them.
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighborhoods!
And everything with them is whores!
Andjunk, dope!
And they leave the gambling to last.
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!
<i>-No.
-Morte.</i>
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,
but he never trusted Hyman Roth
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!
Don Corleone.
Cicci, the door...
You want him to leave now?
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.
The old man had too much wine.
It's late.
How's the baby?
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, it does, Michael.
Kay?
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.
It couldn't be helped, though.
It made me think
of what you once told me.
" In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate. "
That was seven years ago.
I know. I'm trying, darling.
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
Kay, are you all right?
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop! Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
Yeah, come in.
-Mike, are you all right?
-Yeah.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you
and love you
that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
Well, he's got a good heart.
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.
Tom, you're my brother.
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.
I know that.
You're going to take over.
You're going to be the Don.
If what I think has happened,
has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife
and my children,
the future of this family.
-If we catch them, will we find out...
-We won't catch them.
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.
They were killed by somebody
close to us.
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?
See... All our people are businessmen.
Their loyalty is based on that.
One thing I learned from Pop
was to try to think
as people around you think.
On that basis, anything is possible.
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!
Over here! There's two of them.
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognize them.
Won't get anything out of them now.
Fish them out.
Get rid of the bodies.
-Where's Mike?
-Rocco.
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.
I know. Did you like them?
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.
Well, they were friends.
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.
-Will you take me?
-No, I can't, Anthony.
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.
I could help you.
I know. Some day you will.
Get some sleep.
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.
I left Naples. I left Mama.
For a no-good tramp!
Now here I am in America,
in New York.
Alone! Thinking of my mother.
Without news from home.
Finally, a letter from Naples!
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.
Our dear mother -
...is dead!
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.
Sit down, you bum!
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter! Let her go!
Here, take all my money!
Vito, come on.
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
Even my father, in the grocery store.
If he's Italian...
...why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.
Forget that. Did you like my angel?
If you're happy, I'm happy.
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
Hey, you speak Italian?
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
Abbandando, meet my nephew!
How's business?
It's good, it's good.
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.
Even from my father.
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
Oh, no!
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.
What a nice pear!
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?
Did you look inside?
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.
Yeah, sure.
My wife would like it.
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.
Well, he won't mind.
Come on in.
Hey, Vito, come on in!
This is your friend's place?
This is a real palace.
One of the best.
Vito, give me a hand, will you?
Look how pretty it is, Santino!
Come on in.
It's all right. Hyman's in there.
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
-No, thank you.
<i>...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...</i>
-Mr. Roth?
-Come in, Michael.
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.
It's almost over.
-Do you follow the football game?
-Not for a while I haven't.
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.
I heard you had some trouble.
Stupid.
People behaving like that with guns.
The important thing is you're all right.
Good health is the most important thing.
More than success, more than money.
More than power.
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.
Nobody wants another war.
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.
I'll visit him soon.
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.
Nothing is more important.
-You're a wise and considerate man.
-And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.
-There's much I can learn from you.
-Whatever I can do to help, Michael.
-Excuse me. Lunch.
-Come in.
-Thank you, my dear.
-You're going to break your eardrums.
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.
You're young, I'm old and sick.
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.
It's never been done before.
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?
He's small potatoes.
What's up?
We got company?
What's going on?
Michael Corleone is here.
Where is he?
He's in your den. You better hurry.
He's been waiting a half hour.
Is something wrong?
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died. We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Michael, anything. What can I do?
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.
I don't understand. I don't...
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.
I know it was him.
Jesus Christ, Mike.
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.
This used to be my father's old study.
It's changed.
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer. "
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor,
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.
That's what I want him to think.
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.
<i>-Yeah?
-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.</i>
<i>-We need some more help.
-Johnny?</i>
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?
<i>-Who's that, honey?
-Listen good, Fredo.</i>
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.
<i>Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.</i>
<i>-Oh, God.
-Will he come alone?</i>
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.
<i>Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.</i>
<i>All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.</i>
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.
<i>-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.</i>
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.
-Frankie, I've got nobody here.
-Wait in the car, Cicc'.
-Frankie.
-That's okay, Cicc'.
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.
Ritchie. Give us a taste.
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.
-You won't regret it.
-I don't like the C note, Rosato.
I take that as an insult.
Michael Corleone says hello!
Close the door!
Your friend the cop...
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?
What's the matter?
-Is that something on the floor?
-Carmine, not here!
Anthony!
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!
Freddy, it's good to see you.
-How is he?
-He's okay. He's in the back.
Girls, take a hike.
In this room here.
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.
I thought I could help you, Senator.
Hagen?
-Listen, I did not...
-It's all right.
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay. You're very lucky.
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.
When I woke up, I was on the floor.
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?
I passed out.
Just a game. Jesus.
Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus God!
God!
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.
It'll be as though she never existed.
All that's left is our friendship.
-Yes?
-Sorry, but we're not to let you through.
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr. Hagen's. He's coming.
I'll speak to him.
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
-No, within the compound will be fine.
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.
-Am I a prisoner?
-That's not how we see it, Kay.
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.
Joe.
Cuba, Cuba!
Most respected gentlemen.
Welcome to Havana.
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists
for continuing to work with Cuba
for the greatest period of prosperity
in her entire history.
Mr. William Shaw,
representing
the General Fruit Company.
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.
Mr. Petty,
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada,
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,
Mr. Hyman Roth.
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.
A solid gold telephone.
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.
-Mr. President?
-Yes?
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,
my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara
before the New Year.
I want to put you all at ease.
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.
He said that they're making an arrest,
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.
Johnny...
It's nothing.
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.
I'm very pleased
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.
When a man comes
to this point in his life,
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.
-Not for years.
-Hear, hear!
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier
than any of the joints in Vegas.
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...
Real partnership with a government.
Smaller piece.
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.
At the time of my retirement, or death,
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.
But, all of you will share.
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,
the Capri to the Corleone family,
the Sevilla Biltmore also,
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,
Dino and Eddie, for a piece
and to handle the casino operations.
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!
<i>-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!</i>
I saw an interesting thing happen today.
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.
The trucks were owned by your father.
Michael.
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.
The two million never got to the island.
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money
because you worried about the rebels.
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.
90 miles. It's nothing.
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States
and having the cash
to make it possible.
Michael,
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.
Mikey, how are you? Okay?
<i>-Hi! Freddy Corleone.
-Mio frati.</i>
Jesus Christ, what a trip!
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.
You want to count it?
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.
That's great! Havana's great.
It's my kind of town.
-Anybody I know in Havana?
-Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?
No. I've never met them.
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?
I thought maybe we'd go out together.
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.
Have kids. Have a family.
For once in my life, be more like
Pop.
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me. "
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies. "
Sometimes I think it's true.
You're no gypsy, Fredo.
Mikey, I was mad at you.
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?
You want a drink, right? Waiter!
<i>Por favor...</i>
-How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
-Banana Daiquiri.
-That's it?
-That's it.
Uno Banana Daiquiri
and a club soda.
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow
with some government people.
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.
-That's my specialty, right?
-Can I trust you with something?
Of course, Mike.
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace
to bring in the New Year.
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.
For my protection.
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.
-Who?
-Roth.
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.
It was Roth all along.
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.
-How can I help?
-Just go along, as if you know nothing.
-I've already made my move.
-What move?
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.
<i>-Gracias, seÃ±or.
-Buenas noches.</i>
-Honey, go to the casino.
-If you're feeling better.
Feel fine.
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to... Just want to wait.
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?
I know I didn't.
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune. Your father, too.
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.
Later on he had an idea to build a city
out of a desert stop-over
for G. I.s going to the West Coast.
That kid's name was Moe Greene
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.
This was a great man.
A man of vision and guts.
And there isn't even a plaque,
signpost or statue of him in that town.
Someone put a bullet through his eye.
No one knows who gave the order.
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.
And I said to myself,
"This is the business we've chosen. "
I didn't ask
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.
That two million in a bag in your room...
I'm going in to take a nap.
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.
If it isn't, I know I don't.
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.
Senator Payton from Florida...
Judge DeMalco from New York...
Senator Ream from Maryland...
Fred Corngold from UTT.
-That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
-He does?
Gentlemen, it's refill time!
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, PiÃ±a Colada...
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.
-That you got! Con gusto...
-Johnny!
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.
-We never met. Johnny Ola.
-Pleasure.
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!
<i>-Feliz AÃ±o Nuevo!
-Happy New Year.</i>
-Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
-Everybody stands.
-It's worth it. You won't believe this.
-I don't believe it already.
-50 dollars, right?
-You've got a bet, mister.
That's Superman.
Did I tell you or did I tell you?
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't
believe it, but seeing is believing!
-I see it, but still don't believe it!
-50 bucks, Pat.
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!
-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
-I want to see him break a brick!
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.
...and you'll continue to get those.
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.
The American public
believe in non-intervention...
Fredo! Where are you going?
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.
Don't make a big thing about it.
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...
...my position in Cuba is untenable.
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.
And I shall leave the city immediately.
I wish all of you good luck.
<i>Salud!</i>
<i>Viva la revoluciÃ³n! Viva Fidel!</i>
Fredo!
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.
Roth is dead.
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.
Fredo!
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!
Al. Get me a wet towel.
Does Kay know I'm back?
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?
-I took care of it.
-What was it, so I'll know.
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.
Thank you, Al.
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What? Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should
show me some respect.
You should let me wet
my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.
Now don't refuse me.
Understand, paisan?
I understand.
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.
Don't be afraid to tell them!
600 bucks...
Suppose we don't pay?
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.
$200 each...everybody agreed?
Why do we have to pay him?
Vito, leave this to us.
He's one person, we're three.
He's got guns, we've got guns.
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?
This is his neighborhood!
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.
Who?
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.
They don't pay Fanucci.
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.
Now what I say stays in this room.
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.
If Fanucci says $200...
...he means it, Vito!
I'll reason with him.
Leave everything to me.
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.
He'll ask for the money.
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.
Then I'll go and get him to agree.
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.
How can you get him to take less?
That's my business.
Just remember that I did you a favor.
Is it a deal?
Yes.
His family's out of the house.
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.
<i>Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.</i>
Are you sure he's going to go for it?
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
It looks like there's -
$ 100 under my hat.
I was right.
Only $ 100...
I'm short of money right now.
I've been out of work...so just
give me a little time.
You understand, don't you?
You've got balls, young man!
How come I never heard
of you before?
You've got a lot of guts.
I'll find you some work
for good money.
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.
You've done well for yourself.
Enjoy the festa!
Oh, this is too violent for me!
What've you got there?
Michael, your father loves you
very much.
<i>Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,</i>
<i>you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?</i>
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization.</i>
<i>No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.</i>
<i>What was your position?</i>
<i>At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.</i>
<i>-What is that?
-A button, you know, Senator.</i>
<i>No, I don't know. Tell me.</i>
<i>When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?</i>
<i>Mr. Questadt.</i>
<i>-You mean you kill people?
-What?</i>
<i>You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.</i>
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?</i>
<i>Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone.</i>
<i>Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?</i>
<i>No, I never talked to him.</i>
<i>Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?</i>
<i>-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?</i>
<i>I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?</i>
<i>Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.</i>
<i>Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!</i>
<i>You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.</i>
Tell me something, Ma.
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?
He was being strong...
Strong for his family.
But by being strong for his family...
...could he...
...lose it?
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.
No, I meant...lose his family
But you can never lose your family.
Times are changing.
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.
Take it as a gift.
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.
She's in bad trouble.
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.
He told her to get rid of the animal.
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.
I'm so ashamed!
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.
I'm sorry, but...
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.
I can't move!
I want you to talk to him!
Tell him I want to stay here!
What's your landlord's name?
His name is Signor Roberto.
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...
A real pig-sty, eh?
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.
I already rented the place
to another family.
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.
So let her stay.
Impossible.
Are you Sicilian?
No, I'm Calabrese.
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.
How much more a month?
Five bucks.
Here's six months increase in advance.
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.
Come see me in another six months.
Of course, the dog stays. Right?
The dog stays.
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!
Do me this favor.
I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.
What a character!
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!
I'm giving back the money you gave me.
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.
Can I sit down?
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.
The rent stays like before!
I'll even lower it.
I'll lower it $5.
I'll lower it $ 10!
Can I offer you some coffee?
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!
You'll have to excuse me for now.
I wish I could stay longer!
Just call me and I'll be here!
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!
-Vito, what do you think?
-We'll make a big business!
<i>-New York City.
-Would you speak up, please?</i>
<i>New York City.</i>
<i>-Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
-Yes, I am.</i>
<i>-Where was he born?
-Corleone, Sicily.</i>
<i>Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?</i>
<i>Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.</i>
<i>Mr. Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.</i>
<i>For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.</i>
<i>I've come to know them well.</i>
<i>They have honored me
with their support and their friendship.</i>
<i>I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.</i>
<i>However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings</i>
<i>in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.</i>
<i>Before I leave, I do want to say this,</i>
<i>that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever</i>
<i>a slur upon the great Italian people.</i>
<i>I can state from my own knowledge
and experience</i>
<i>that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,</i>
<i>patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.</i>
<i>It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples</i>
<i>to give a bad name to the whole barrel.</i>
<i>Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi</i>
<i>to the present day,</i>
<i>Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.</i>
<i>They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.</i>
<i>I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.</i>
<i>Mr. Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.</i>
<i>We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.</i>
<i>He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.</i>
<i>-Are you?
-No, I'm not.</i>
<i>He testified that you are
personally responsible</i>
<i>for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947</i>
<i>and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.</i>
<i>-Do you deny this?
-Yes, I do.</i>
<i>Is it true that in the year 1950</i>
<i>you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five Families" in New York</i>
<i>to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?</i>
<i>-It's a complete falsehood.
-Mr. Questadt.</i>
<i>Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?</i>
<i>No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.</i>
<i>I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.</i>
<i>Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?</i>
<i>No, I do not.</i>
<i>Senator, my client
would like to read a statement.</i>
<i>Mr. Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.</i>
<i>Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.</i>
<i>He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!</i>
<i>No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read
his statement. I'II put it in the record.</i>
<i>In the hopes of clearing
my family name</i>
<i>to give my children their share
of the American way of life</i>
<i>without a blemish on their name
and background,</i>
<i>I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.</i>
<i>I consider it a great personal dishonor
to have to deny that I am a criminal.</i>
<i>I wish to have the following noted
for the record...</i>
<i>That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two</i>
<i>and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defense of my country.</i>
<i>That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.</i>
<i>That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy</i>
<i>whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name</i>
<i>has ever been made public.</i>
<i>I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,</i>
<i>although it's my right to do so.</i>
<i>I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me</i>
<i>and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name</i>
<i>with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.</i>
<i>I'm sure we're impressed. Particularity
with your love for our country.</i>
<i>We'II be in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday</i>
<i>when we will produce a witness who'II
corroborate the charges against you.</i>
<i>At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.</i>
<i>I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!</i>
Ten-to-one shot, you said.
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.
-Well, just get a good night's sleep.
-Yeah.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.
I'll shave you myself in the morning.
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.
Come on! I saw this 19 times.
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.
You'll live better here
than most people outside.
Some deal!
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth. He engineered it, Michael.
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers
they tried to kill him.
He thought you double-crossed him.
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared
and shouted that you'd turned on him.
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.
What about Fredo?
What does he know?
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.
Roth, he played this one beautifully.
I'm going to talk to Fredo.
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark.
I didn't know all that much.
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?
Anything you can tell me now?
They've got Pentangeli.
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.
I swear to God I didn't know.
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.
He said that he wanted to talk.
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,
it would be good for the family.
And you believed that story?
You believed that?
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!
-I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
-Taken care of me?
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere. "
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.
Fredo,
you're nothing to me now.
Not a brother, not a friend.
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.
I don't want to see you at the hotels.
I don't want you near my house.
When you see our mother, I want
to know in advance, so I won't be there.
You understand?
Mikey.
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.
-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
-Frankie Five-Angels...
<i>This committee will come to order!</i>
<i>-State your name, please.
-Frank Pentangeli.</i>
<i>-Where were you born?
-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.</i>
<i>Where do you live now?</i>
<i>I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.</i>
<i>We have here a witness
that will further testify</i>
<i>to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.</i>
<i>This witness has had no buffer
between himself and Michael Corleone.</i>
<i>He can corroborate enough charges</i>
<i>for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.</i>
-Senator.
-Thank you, Chairman.
<i>Mr. Pentangeli.</i>
<i>Mr. Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?</i>
<i>Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,</i>
<i>and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?</i>
<i>I never knew any Godfather.</i>
<i>I have my own family.</i>
<i>Mr. Pentangeli, you...</i>
<i>You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.</i>
<i>I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...</i>
<i>were you at any time a member of
a crime organization</i>
<i>led by Michael Corleone?</i>
I don't know nothing about that!
I was in the olive oil business
with his father
but that was a long time ago.
<i>We have a sworn affidavit.</i>
<i>Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.</i>
<i>Do you deny this confession, and do
you realize what will happen if you do?</i>
<i>The FBI guys promised me a deal</i>
<i>so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.</i>
<i>But it was all lies. Everything!</i>
<i>They kept saying,</i>
<i>"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".</i>
<i>So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"</i>
<i>Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?</i>
I can answer that.
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
<i>-Is he related to the witness?
-He is, I believe, his brother.</i>
<i>-Will he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand English.</i>
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.
<i>-He knows nothing about this?
-To my knowledge, nothing.</i>
<i>I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.</i>
<i>-The witness is excused.
-Senator!</i>
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!
-Michael, excuse me.
-Hello, darling.
The children are outside. We're going.
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.
Rocco?
I'll be in my room, Mike.
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.
I'm very happy for you.
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, I'm not going to stay long.
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.
-I wasn't going to say anything...
-What do you mean, "too late"?
What really happened with Pentangeli?
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.
Where is he now?
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.
All he had to do was show his face.
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!
Things between men and women
will not change.
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!
Over!
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.
Kay...
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?
-Michael, you haven't heard me.
-Kay, what do you want from me?
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?
Don't you know that?
Kay...
In time, you'll feel differently.
You'll be glad I stopped you now.
I know that.
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.
Yes.
I know what that meant to you.
I'll make it up to you, Kay.
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...
I'm going to change.
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.
-We'll go on.
-Oh, Michael!
Michael, you are blind.
It wasn't a miscarriage.
It was an abortion.
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.
Something that's unholy and evil!
I didn't want your son, Michael!
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!
It was an abortion, Michael.
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...
-You won't take my children.
-I will.
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.
My partner in America, in New York.
His name is Vito Corleone.
We'll send him olive oil from here.
To his company in America.
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.
Where is this young man
from New York?
Have him come closer.
I can't see him so good.
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.
Bless you!
What's your name?
You took the name of this town!
And what's your father's name?
His name was...Antonio Andolini.
Louder, I don't hear so good.
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...
...and this is for you!
Michael, say goodbye.
Hi, Al.
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?
Tom, where's Mike?
Waiting for you to leave.
-Can I talk with him?
-Sorry, Fredo. No chance.
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.
Michael, it's Connie.
Michael...
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.
Is Kay coming?
No.
Fredo's in the house with Mama.
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.
That's right.
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?
Please, I want to talk to you.
Michael, I hated you for so many years.
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know
that I could hurt you.
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.
And I forgive you.
Can't you forgive Fredo?
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.
Connie.
Tom, sit down.
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.
-That plane goes to Miami.
-That's right. That's where I want it met.
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
It would be
like trying to kill the President.
-There's no way we can get to him!
-Tom, you surprise me.
If anything in this life is certain,
if history has taught us anything,
it's that you can kill anyone.
-Rocco?
-Difficult. Not impossible.
Good.
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?
I thought you were going to tell me that
you were moving your family to Vegas
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?
-Let's do business.
-All right.
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.
Are you with me in these things,
or what?
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress
and move them all to Las Vegas.
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?
So...you're staying?
Yes, I'm staying.
What do you want me to do?
Hey, Anthony.
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?
-Would you like that?
-Okay.
You know, when I was your age,
I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.
I was the only one that caught a fish.
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.
What else have you got?
Everything will be okay.
-Did my brother go back?
-Yeah, don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.
Tom,
what do I do now?
Frankie.
You were always interested
in politics and history.
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organization of the families,
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".
-And it worked.
-Yeah, it worked.
Those were the great old days,
you know.
We was like the Roman Empire.
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah,
it was once.
Frankie.
When a plot
against the Emperor failed
the plotters were always
given a chance
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?
Only the rich guys.
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.
And their families were taken care of.
That was a good break, a nice deal.
Yeah.
They went home
and sat in a hot bath
opened up their veins
and bled to death.
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.
-See you, Tom.
-Addio, Frankie.
Kay. You have to go.
-So pretty...
-Kay, please hurry. He's coming.
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.
Kay, please.
All right.
Mary, come here.
Anthony.
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.
Easy.
Anthony! Anthony!
-He's here, we're going fishing.
-No!
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.
Shit!
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.
-I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.
Hey, Anthony.
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.
Let's go.
-Mr. Roth, I must take you into custody.
-I understand.
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?
I'm a retired investor on a pension.
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.
Frankie!
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.
I came home to vote
in the presidential election
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.
Jesus Christ.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
Sit down. Talk to each other.
Hey, Mr. Einstein...
-The cake.
-Sally, get in here!
-I was scared.
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.
Let's see that thing.
That's nice!
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah. You help her, Carlo.
-What is that? Rum?
-Yeah.
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
-30,000 enlisted this morning.
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.
-That's Pop talking.
-You're right, that's Pop talking!
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college and join the army!
I did.
I've enlisted in the Marines.
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.
-I didn't ask for it.
I didn't want it.
Come on! Knock it off!
-Punk!
-Sonny, sit down.
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!
Go and show Carlo the tree.
Nice.
Nice.
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.
Don't encourage him!
Get me a drink. Go on!
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.
You've talked to my father
about my future?
-My future.
-Mikey, he has high hopes for you.
-I have my own plans for my future.
-Did you go to college to get stupid?
He's here!
Come on.
Stupid!
Surprise!
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
<i>That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...</i>
